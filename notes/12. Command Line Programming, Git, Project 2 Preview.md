Gitlet overview. Older version taught by Hilfinger was apparently longer. Implement this gitlet then check other version for what else to implement

Every git commit is stored:
- Author
- date
- commit message
- List of all files and their versions
    - Versions is git-SHA1 hash
- parent's commit id

Git commit ID also has hash
