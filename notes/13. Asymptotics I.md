# Asymptotics I

## Efficient Programming
What is efficiency? Reducing programming cost, execution cost.


## Techniques for Measuring Computational Cost

### Technique 1:
Measure execution time in seconds using a client program.

## Asymptotic behavior
Very large N (asymptotic behavior), big amoutns of data. Parabolas vs lines\
Order of growth

## Big-Theta
Describes order of growth of a function
Big theta is like "equals"

## Big O
Big O is like "less than or equal
