# Heaps and PQs

## Priority Queue interface
```java
public interface MinPQ<Item> {
    public voic add(Item x);
    public Item getSmallest();
    public removeSmallest();
    public int size(); 
}
```

### PQ implementations:
- Ordered Array
    - O(N) add cause you might have to reorder the array
- BST
    - O(log N) operations
- Hashtable
    - O(N) getSmallest, hashtable is not ordered


## Heaps:
Properties:
- Min-heap: Every node is less than or equal to both of its children
- Complete tree: all nodes to far left as possible, missing nodes only on bottom level (if any)

For add() operation, you add the node as a leaf node to left most available position. Then, you percolate it upwards until it matches min-heap property

For deletion() operation, take the last item (rightmost leaf) and stick it as root, then rearrange until min-heap property

### Heap operations summary:
- getSmallest() - return root node
- add(x) - add node to last position and rearrange until min-heap satisfied
- removeSmallest() - remove root node, make last leaf node the new root and rearrange until min-heap satisfied

## Tree representations
Storing keys as an array

```java
public class Tree<Key> {
    Key[] keys;
}
```

Where index of the key corresponds to tree node placement

How to find parent of a node? Use formula:
```java
public int parent(int k) {
    return (k-1)/2;
}
```
