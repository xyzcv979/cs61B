# Tree and Graph Traversals

## Tree recap
Trees useful for org chart, file systems

### Tree traversals
- Inorder
    - left, root, right
- Preoder
    - root, left, right
- Postorder
    - left, right, root
- Level Order
    - iterate by levels, left to right

## Graphs
Trees good for hiearchical relationships, but not everything is a hierarchy. Like a city, there are many connections, cycles, etc.

### What is a graph?
Graph consists of:
- Set of nodes
- Set of edges which connect 2 nodes

Graph types:
- directed vs undirected
- cyclic vs acyclic

A **cycle** is path where first and last nodes are the same

Set of connected nodes is a **connected component**


### Graph Problems:
Many questions we can ask about a graph:
- s-t path - Is there a path between 2 nodes?
- Connectivity - Is the graph connected? i.e. path between all nodes
- Biconnectivity - is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?
- Shortest path - what is shortest path between 2 nodes
- Cycle detection - is there a cycle?
- Euler Tour - is there a cycle that uses every edge exactly once?
- Hamilton tour - is there a cycle that uses every node exactly once?
- Planarlity - Can you draw the graph on paper with no crossing edges?
- Isomorphism - are 2 graphs isomorphic? (the same graph in disguise)

### Graph Traversals
DFS to compute path from a node to every other node
