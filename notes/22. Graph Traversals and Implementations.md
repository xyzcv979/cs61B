# Graph Traversals and Implementations

## BFS (Breadth First Search), aka level order traversal
Where as DFS goes down a path until the last child node, and then goes to neighbors\
BFS visits all child nodes before grandchildren

```
Initialize queue
repeat until que empty:
    remove node n from que
    for each neigh of v:
        mark neigh
        add neigh to que
        set edgeTo[neigh] = v              // This tracks how we got to node neigh 
        set distTo[neigh] = distTo[v] + 1  // this tracks distance travelled from starting node to neigh
```


## Representing Graphs
Now discuss how to implement these graphs and graph algorithms in code

### Graph API
```java
public class Graph{
    public Graph(int vertex);
    public void addEdge(int vertex, int w);
    Iterable<Integer> adj(int vertext);
    int numOfV();
    int numOfE();
}
```

### Graph Representations
- Adjacency Matrix
    - 2D array, edge connecting vertex s to t, if corresponding cell is true, that means they're connected
- Edge sets
    - Storing a single set of all edges
- Adjacency Lists
    - Array of lists, indexed by vertex number

### Runtime
DFS/BFS on graph adj list runs in O(V + E) while adj matrix runs O(V^2)
