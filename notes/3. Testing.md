# Mon 01 /25 - Testing
Testing is important to know that code works. Following TDD principles, you should write the tests first, make them fail, then write the code to make them succeed

Red -> Green -> Refactor

Write a test method to test functionality, implement it to make it pass

Repeat for every new method

### Test sort() method:
```java
public static void testSort(){
    input = {b, a, d}
    expected = {a, b, d}

    Sort.sort(input);
    for (int i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        if (!input[i].equals(expected[i]) {
            "test failed"
        }
    }
}

public class Sort {
    public static void sort(String[] arr) {

    }
}
```


This is pretty tedious, so use JUnit which is built-in java testing library that makes it easy to test
```java
public static void testSort() {
    String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
    String[] expected = {"an", "egg", "have", "i"};
    Sort.sort(input);
    org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals(expected, input);
}
```


### Selection Sort:
Simplest sorting method.

O(n^2) time

Find lowest number and swap to left side, increment left ptr, continue until fully sorted


### Recursive selection sort
Since Java doesn't have array slicing, we need a helper method to pass in the index of the start for the array. 

Increment the index 
```java
sort(arr) {
    sort(arr, 0) // helper method
}
/** sort helper that sorts from an index onwards */
sort(arr, start) {
    findSmallest
    swap(arr, start, smallest)
    sort(arr, start+1)
}
```

### Debugging Process:
Use debugger to view the states

For cs61b specifically, can use java visualizer to visualize classes, variables, pointers, etc.

Make change to fix the bug in the code, then fix the test and make sure they pass


## Summary:
Testing is effective, use debugger more often. Test a method, make it fail, write the code to make it pass, and repeat for every new method. Use JUnit testing library for ease (like method to compare objects instead of doing it yourself)
