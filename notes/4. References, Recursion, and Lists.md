## The Mystery of the Walrus
```Java
/** Object reference vs value reference */
Walrus a = new Walrus(weight:1000, tuskSize:8.3);
Walrus b;
b = a;
b.weight = 5;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
// Walrus(5, 8.3)
// Walrus(5, 8.3)

int x = 5;
int y;
y = x;
x = 2;
System.out.println("x is: " + x);
System.out.println("y is: " + y);
// x is: 2
// y is: 5
```


Java allocates memory space for variables, objects, arrays.\
This memory cannot be accessed by the developer (Only C and C++). This is a feature. Prevents weird and dangerous behavior when you access memory not relevant to your program

Objects stored as 64 bits in memory

## Pointers
Pointers of an object points to its memory reference\

## Paramter Passing:
Parameters passed into a function is "copying the bits" \
AKA "**pass by value**"

An object passed in as argument is copying the bits and thus, the memory reference of that object. A primitive type is just a copy of the value and not a reference


## Lists
```Java
public class IntList {
    public int first;
    public IntList rest;        

    public IntList(int f, IntList r) {
        first = f;
        rest = r;
    }
}

```

### Size of List (recursive)
```Java
IntList class {
    ...

    public int size() {
        if !rest {
            return 1
        }
        return 1 + this.rest.size()
    }
}
```

### Size of List (iterative)
```Java
IntList class {
    ...

    public int size() {
        IntList curr = this;
        int sz = 0;
        while (curr != null) {
            sz++;
            curr = curr.rest;
        }
        return sz;
    }
}
```

### Get method for List (recursive)
```java
/** Return the value of the ith item in the list */
    public int get(int idx) {
        if (idx == 0) {
            return first
        }
        return rest.get(idx-1)
    }
```
