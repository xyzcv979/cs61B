# 01/29 SLLists, Nested Classes, Sentinel Nodes

## List Class
```Java
public class IntNode {
    public int item;
    public IntNode next;

    public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
        item = i;
        next = n;
    }
}
```

```Java
/** SLList is a list of integers which hides the truth within (Hides the fact that there exists a null link from the user*/
public class SLList {
    public IntNode first;

    public SLList(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
    }

    /** Adds x to the front of the last */
    public void addFirst(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, first);
    }

    /** Return first item of the list */
    public int getFirst() {
        reutrn first.item
    }

/**
 * SLList L = new SLList(15);
 * L.addFirst(10);
 * L.addFirst(5);
 * int x = L.getFirst()
 * /
}
```

## Public vs Private
Setting class variable to private prevent other classes from changing it\
Restrict access, hide implementation details, enforce compiler errors if user/developer tries to change it which could be harmful

## Nested Class
Why? The nested class is only used by the parent class. Better code readability. If nested class is never used except by parent, nest it and set to private. 

```java
public class SLList {
       public class IntNode {
            public int item;
            public IntNode next;
            public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
                item = i;
                next = n;
            }
       }

       private IntNode first; 

       public SLList(int x) {
           first = new IntNode(x, null);
       } 
...

```

## Cache Size function
Size function is O(n) time\
Instead, can just create size class variable, init to 1 when node created, and increment whenever node added. Decrement when node deleted.\
Size function now just returns size variable\
This becomes O(1) time


## Sentinel Nodes
Encounter problems when calling a function and the SLList is null (empty list)\
To standarize all lists, create an empty head node (sentinel node)\
Calling sentinel.next (this is the real first node of the list)

```java
public class SLList {
    public IntNode sentinel;
    public int size;

    ...
}
```

## Invariants
Invariant is a fact about a data structure that is guaranteed to be true (assume there are no bugs in your code)\
SLList w/ sentinel nodes has at least the following invariants:
- Sentinel reference always point to sentinel node
- Front item is always sentinel.next.item
- size variable is always the total num of items added

Invariants make it easier to reason with your code. When writing code, you code knowing the invariants are true and don't need to handle errors regarding them
