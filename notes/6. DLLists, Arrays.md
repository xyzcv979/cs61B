# DLLists, Arrays

## DLLists
Singular linked list add to tail is pretty slow because you have to find the tail. O(n) time\
So what if, you had pointer to last item? O(1) time for add\
But delete still slow O(n) time.\
So what if, you had every node have pointer to previous node. You get Doubly Linked List. O(1) time deletion of any node and adding to tail

### Sentinel upgrade
Null node as front sentinel\
This works until you get ugly situations with doubly linked list\
So create another null node as back sentinel that tail points to

Alternate approach is circular linked list. Previous of sentinel node points to tail. Next of tail points to sentinel node's next

## Generics
Our DLList takes in integers. How can we insteadc use generics? (strings, ints, others)\
We can defer type reference till later by using generics


```java
/** Original DLList*/
public class DLList {
    private IntNode sentinel;
    private int size;

    public class IntNode {
        public IntNode prev;
        public int item;
        public IntNode next;
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```

```java
/** DLList w/ Generics*/
public class DLList<BleepBlorp> {
    private IntNode sentinel;
    private int size;

    public class IntNode {
        public IntNode prev;
        public BleepBlorp item;
        public IntNode next;
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```

```java
/** Examples: */
DLList<String> d2 = new DLList<>("hello");
d2.addLast("world");

DLList<Integer> d1 = new DLList<>(5);
d1.insertFront(10);

```


## Arrays
Fixed sequence of N memory addresses. 64 bit memory box

```java
int[] x = new int[3];
int[] y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### 2D Arrays
Arrays can contain references to other arrays

### Arrays vs Classes
Array memory space is numbered and accessed via [] notation. Class memory boxes are named and access via dot notation\
Array boxes must be of same type, classes can be different\
