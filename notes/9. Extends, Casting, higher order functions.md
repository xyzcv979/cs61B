# 9. Extends, Casting, higher order functions

## Extends
Subclass extends another class (not inteface, that would be implements)\
**Extends** keyword\
Continues the functionality of the superclass, reuses code\
"is-a" relationship. Student is-a Human, dog is-a animal

Extends keyword inheri all members of parent class:\
- All instance and static variables
- All methods
- All nested classes\
Note, constructors and private variables/methods not inherited

```java
public class RotatingSLList<Item> extends SLList<Item>
```

### Extends w/ Override
Override the parent class's method

```java
public class VengefulSLList<Item> extends SLList<Item> {
    SLList<Item> deletedItems;

    public VengefulSLList() {
        deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
    }

    @Override                              // Override
    public Item removeLast() {
        Item x = super.removeLast();       // Calling parent's method 
        deletedItems.addLast(x);
        return x;
    }

    /** Prints deleted items. */
    public void printLostItems() {
        deletedItems.print();
    }
}

```

### Constructors not inherited
java implicitly calls superclass's constructor via 
```java
super()
super(x) // if superclass takes in param
```


## The Object Class
Every type in java is descendant of **Object** class\
**Object** class is the parent class of all classes\
What does it do? Provide built-in methods that are used by other methods\
- hashcode()
- tostring()
- 

## Encapsulation
A fundamental principle of object oriented programming\
Used for **managing complexity** which is a major challenge with large programs\
"Design for change", build **modular**, interchangeable pieces that can be swapped around w/o breaking the system\
**Hide information** that others don't need

### How Inheritance breaks encapsulation
Child class has a overriden method which calls parent classes' method but parent's method calls method of the same name as the method overriden in child. This becomes infinite loop cause the child classes' overriden method is called

## Type Checking and Casting
Dynamic method selection, dynamic method lookup is process of determining the method is executed at runtime based on dynamic type of the object\
This is useful to note because when an object of static type, has different dynamic type, calls method belonging to the dynamic type and not static type, the compiler will give compiler error cause it doesn't know the dynamic type

### Casting
Casting tells compiler that an expression has a specific compile-time type. This prevents comple errors when something has a different dynamic type

```java
Poodle largerPoodle = (Poodle) maxDog(frank, frankJr); // compiles! Right hand side has compile-time type Poodle after casting
```

Beware of casting because you're telling compiler to ignore it's type-safe checks. If it passes compile time, but encounters error in runtime which gives exception, this could be bad

## Higher Order Functions
Functions that treats other functions as data to be passed in

```python
def tenX(x):
    return 10*x

def do_twice(f, x):
    return f(f(x))

print(do_twice(tenX, 2))
```

How to do this in java?/
In old school java, memory boxes (variables) could not contain pointers to functions/
To get around this, take advantage of interface inheritance

```java
public interface IntUnaryFunction {
    int apply(int x);
}
```

Now write class which implements IntUnaryFunction
```java
// Similar to tenX function written in python
public class TenX implements IntUnaryFunction {
    public int apply(int x) {
        return 10 * x;
    }
}
```

```java
// Do_twice method
public static int do_twice(IntUnaryFunction f, int x) {
    return f.apply(f.apply(x));
}
```

```java
// Print it
System.out.println(do_twice(new TenX(), 2));
```


# Summary: Inheritance
**Extends** keyword for a child class to inherit parent class (not interface)/
When calling overriden methods:/
- Compiler only calls an object's static type methods
- For overriden methods (not overloaded), actualy method called is based on dynamic type
- Can use **casting** to overrule compiler type checking
